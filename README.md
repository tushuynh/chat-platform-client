# Installation

2. Go to [Chat Platform Server repository](https://github.com/tushuynh/chat-platform-server) and follow all the instructions on setting up the backend.
3. Run both projects using:

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

4. There is no landing page, the main routes are:
   - `/register` route to create an account
   - `/login` to login to the app
   - `/conversations` is where all the magic happens
